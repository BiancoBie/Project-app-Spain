Hello!

I hope you like the project that I worked on for 2 weeks. 
I used Java to bring this project to life, along with XML. 
I unfortunately couldn't upload the contents as they were, I had to archive them in order to upload them.
I did this project 3 years ago, with the help of the other co-workers in the company. 
It is not very detailed, but I will work on it in the future to be sure all the functionalities I had in mind will work.

Thank you for reading this document,
Bianca
